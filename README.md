# Real-Time Fraud Detection 

Example application for real-time fraud detection.

## Setup


1. Setup this repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinybirdco/fraud-detection-demo.git
cd fraud-detection-demo
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install and configure the CLI

To start working with data projects as if they were software projects, First, install the CLI in a virtual environment.
You'll need python3 installed.


```bash
python3 -mvenv .e
. .e/bin/activate
pip install -cli
tb auth --interactive
```

Choose your region: 1 for `us-east`, 2 for `eu`. A new `.tinyb` file will be created.


```bash
tb push --no-check
```



Goal: Build a fully automated, AI-powered real-time fraud detection system for financial transactions. The system should handle high-throughput streaming data, detect fraudulent activities in milliseconds, and automatically prevent suspicious transactions.

ðŸ“Œ PART 1: DATA INGESTION & PIPELINES
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Data Sources:

Stream financial transactions from multiple banks, payment gateways, and APIs.
Handle both structured (SQL, NoSQL) and unstructured (logs, JSON) data.
Implement an event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Pulsar.
ETL Pipelines & Feature Engineering:

Implement a real-time ETL pipeline using Apache Flink or Spark Streaming.
Perform feature extraction on transaction patterns, user behavior, geolocation, and device metadata.
Store processed data in Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or HDFS.
ðŸ“Œ PART 2: MACHINE LEARNING-BASED FRAUD DETECTION
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Model Selection & Training:

Train fraud detection models using XGBoost, LightGBM, or deep learning (LSTMs, GNNs).
Use unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, DBSCAN) for new fraud patterns.
Real-Time Inference:

Deploy models as low-latency APIs using FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving, or TorchServe.
Process 10,000+ transactions per second with <50ms response time.
Model Explainability & Fairness:

Implement SHAP or LIME for explainability.
Detect and mitigate bias in fraud detection models.
ðŸ“Œ PART 3: AUTOMATED FRAUD PREVENTION & ALERTING
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Real-Time Fraud Prevention System:

Auto-block transactions above a certain fraud score threshold.
Implement a dynamic rules engine for risk-based decision-making.
Alerting & Incident Response:

Send real-time fraud alerts via Twilio, Slack, or email.
Implement a fraud case management dashboard for investigators.
User Verification & Identity Protection:

Integrate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) & biometric verification.
Detect location-based anomalies (e.g., login from two different continents within minutes).
ðŸ“Œ PART 4: DATA STORAGE, GOVERNANCE & SECURITY
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Scalable Storage:

Store transactions in Apache Cassandra, PostgreSQL, or Google BigQuery.
Implement data partitioning & indexing for performance optimization.
Data Security & Compliance:

Ensure GDPR & PCI-DSS compliance.
Encrypt all sensitive data using AES-256.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logs.
ðŸ“Œ PART 5: VISUALIZATION & DASHBOARDS
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Fraud Analytics Dashboard:

Build a React.js/Next.js dashboard with real-time fraud insights.
Implement transaction heatmaps & fraud trend analysis.
Show alerts, flagged transactions, and fraud risk scores in an intuitive UI.
Interactive Reports & Visualization:

Integrate Apache Superset, Metabase, or Power BI for data analysis.
Provide fraud detection accuracy metrics & model performance tracking.
ðŸ“Œ PART 6: CI/CD, TESTING & DEPLOYMENT
ðŸ”¥ Mandatory Requirements:
Automated Testing & Model Validation:

Implement unit & integration tests using PyTest, Great Expectations.
Perform A/B testing on fraud detection models.
Performance & Load Testing:

Simulate 1M+ transactions per minute using Locust or K6.
Optimize latency & throughput for fraud detection API.
CI/CD Pipeline & Cloud Deployment:

Automate deployments using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.
Deploy using Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), and Terraform.
